# **Agile methodologies**

Agile software development process or methodology is a software development technique which involves the idea of iterative software development.
Agile development method helps to deiver software fast and incorporate necessary changes.

There are different popular agile methodologies. Some of the most popular agile methodologies are:

1. Kanban
2. Scrum
3. Extreme Programming (XP)
4. Crystal
5. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
6. Lean
7. Feature Driven Development (FDD)

## **1. Kanban**

Kanban is a agile sodtwarement method that uses visual methods for developing and managing projects. The word **Kanban**  is originated form Japanese Language which roughly translates to **visual board** or **signboard**.

Projects through Kanban are overseen with the help of the Kanban Board, which is divided into columbs to show the process flow of the software development.

It encourages steadily collaboration and transparency to enable team members to be equipped with the right stage of the development at any time and have a cohesive flow of work at all times.

## **2. Scrum**

It is lightweight framework of Agile Project Management which can be used to conduct iterative and all types of incremental projects.

- Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called **sprints**.

- The development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, hence managing only one sprint at at time.

- The time period of a sprint ranges form 2-4 weeks.

-Progress of the development team can be accessed through a meeting called **Daily Scrum**.

- The **Scrum Master** maintains the team focused towards their targets.

## **3. Extreme Programming (XP)**

Extreme Programming (XP) is a agile method that emphasizes teamwork, communication and feedback. It fcocus on constant development and customer satisfaction. It also uses sprints or short development cycles similar to that of Scrum.

XP method is based on the four simple values:

- Uniformity
- Simplicity
- Communitacion
- Feedback and
- Endurance.

## **4. Crystal**

Crystal is a group of smaller agile development methodlolgies comprising of *Crystal Yellow*, *Crystal Clear*, *Crystal Red*, *Crystal Orange*, and more. Every methodologies has its own specific framework.

Similar to other agile methodologies, Crystal also addresses prompt delivery of software, regularity, less administration with high invlovement of users, and customer satisfaction.

Depending on the nature of the project or system criticality such as *Comfort (C)*, *Essential Money (E)*, *Discretionary Money (D)*, and *Life (L)*, the kind of crystal agile methodology is chosen.

## **5. Dymanic System Development Method (DSDM)**

DSDM is iterative, incremental and Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology. The framework of DSDM incoroporates feasibility and business studies, prototype iteration and functional model, design and develop iteration, and deployment.

DSDM works of *eight principles*, that guide the team and build a persoective for delivering a product on time and under budget, are:

- To converge on the business requrement,
- Deliver on time,
- Collaborate,
- Nevermore negotiate quality,
- Create incrementally from firm associations,
- Expand iteratively,
- Communicate frequently and clearly, and
- Manifest control.
